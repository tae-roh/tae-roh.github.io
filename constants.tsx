  intro: `Hello! I am a Software Engineer at **Samsung Electronics GTR (Global Technology Research)**. My research interests lie in **Reinforcement Learning** and **Robot Learning**.
  
  When I was little, I wanted to become one of the cool robots I saw in cartoons. I eventually learned that wasn’t quite possible—but I still believe robots can become our friendly and safe companions.
